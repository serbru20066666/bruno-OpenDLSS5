// Every gate the port has, in one command:
//
//   node tools/check.mjs
//
// Three runs, because they check different things and none of them subsumes another:
//
//   self-test      every numeric primitive against the C++ reference, over exhaustive inputs
//   parity nr512   75 block boundaries against what native produced from recorded input features
//   parity nr768   the head and the composed image against what native produced from a recorded proxy
//
// The boundary fixture stops at block 69: of the full-resolution post block, the head matrix and the
// composition it sees only an 8-bit image, compared within one code. The end-to-end fixture carries no
// boundaries: it says nothing about where inside the network a difference began. Run both or neither. A page
// fails on a fixture that does not carry every reference its checks declare.
//
// NR_FIXTURES must point at the directory holding nr512 and nr768. NR_HEADED=1 opens real windows.
